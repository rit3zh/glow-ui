## ⚡️ What it is

- A React context for managing dialog (modal) open/close state
- Provides methods to open and close dialogs
- Used by dialog components and hooks

---

## 📝 Context Shape

```ts
export type DialogContextType = {
  open: boolean;
  setOpen: (open: boolean) => void;
};
```

---

## 🚀 Usage Example

```tsx
import { useContext } from "react";
import { DialogContext } from "cli/components/organisms/dialog/context/DialogContext";
import { Button } from "react-native";

function MyDialogTrigger() {
  const dialog = useContext(DialogContext);
  return <Button title="Open" onPress={() => dialog?.setOpen(true)} />;
}
```

---

## 🧩 Dialog Component Types

- `DialogComponent`: The main dialog component with subcomponents (Trigger, Content, Title, Description, Close)
- `DialogContentProps`, `DialogTitleProps`, `DialogDescriptionProps`, `DialogCloseProps`, `DialogTriggerProps`: Props for each dialog subcomponent

---

## 💡 Tip

Use the DialogContext to control dialogs from anywhere in your app, and wrap dialog-related components in a provider for shared state!
