export interface ToastContextValue {
  toasts: Toast[];
  show: (content: React.ReactNode | string, options?: ToastOptions) => string;
  update: (
    id: string,
    content: React.ReactNode | string,
    options?: ToastOptions,
  ) => void;
  dismiss: (id: string) => void;
  dismissAll: () => void;
}
```

## 🚀 Usage Example

```tsx
import { useContext } from "react";
import { ToastContext } from "src/components/molecules/Toast/ToastProvider";
import { Button } from "react-native";

function MyComponent() {
  const toast = useContext(ToastContext);
  return (
    <Button
      onPress={() => toast.show("Hello, world!", { type: "success" })}
      title="Show Toast"
    />
  );
}
```

## 🧩 Toast Options

- `duration` (number): How long the toast is visible (ms)
- `type` ("default" | "success" | "error" | "warning" | "info"): Semantic type
- `position` ("top" | "bottom"): Where the toast appears
- `onClose` (function): Called when the toast closes
- `action` (object): Optional action button with `label` and `onPress`

## 💡 Tip

Use the ToastContext to show, update, or dismiss toasts from anywhere in your app!
