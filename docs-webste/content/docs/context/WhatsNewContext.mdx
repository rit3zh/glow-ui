---

## ⚡️ What it is

- A React context for managing "What's New" modal state and content
- Provides methods to open, close, and set the modal content
- Includes a hook (`useWhatsNew`) for easy access

---

## 📝 Context Shape

```ts
type WhatsNewContextType = {
  open: () => void;
  close: () => void;
  setContent: (c: React.ReactNode) => void;
};
```

---

## 🚀 Usage Example

```tsx
import { useWhatsNew } from "src/components/templates/whats-new/context/WhatsNewContext";
import { Button } from "react-native";

function WhatsNewButton() {
  const { open, setContent } = useWhatsNew();
  return (
    <Button
      title="Show What's New"
      onPress={() => {
        setContent(<div>✨ New features available!</div>);
        open();
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

---

## 🧩 Full Implementation

```ts
import { createContext, useContext } from "react";

type WhatsNewContextType = {
  open: () => void;
  close: () => void;
  setContent: (c: React.ReactNode) => void;
};

export const WhatsNewContext = createContext<WhatsNewContextType | undefined>(
  undefined,
);

export const useWhatsNew = <T extends WhatsNewContextType>(): T => {
  const context = useContext(WhatsNewContext);
  if (!context)
    throw new Error(
      "WhatsNew.Trigger or Content must be used inside <WhatsNew>",
    );
  return context as T;
};
```

## 💡 Tip

Wrap your "What's New" modal and triggers in a `WhatsNewContext.Provider` to share state and content easily!
