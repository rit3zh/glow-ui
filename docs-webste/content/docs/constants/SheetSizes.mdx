## ⚡️ What it is

- An array of snap points for floating sheets
- Used to determine minimized and expanded positions
- Calculated based on the device window height

---

## 📝 Values

- `sheetSizes[0]`: Minimized position (85 pixels from the top)
- `sheetSizes[1]`: Expanded position (90% of the window height)

---

## 🚀 Usage Example

```ts
import { sheetSizes } from "src/components/templates/sheet/floating-sheet/constants/sizes/sheetSizes";

const minimized = sheetSizes[0];
const expanded = sheetSizes[1];
```

---

## 🧩 Full Implementation

```ts
import { Dimensions } from "react-native";

const { height } = Dimensions.get("window");
export const sheetSizes = [85, height * 0.9];
```

## 💡 Tip

You can use these constants to snap your floating sheet to common positions for a consistent user experience!
